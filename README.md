# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Prediction project! This repository contains code and documentation for predicting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to build a model that can accurately classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various features.

## Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a breast cancer diagnosis based on patient data.

## Dataset
We use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

### Features
- **Radius**: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
- **Texture**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values
- **Perimeter**
- **Area**
- **Smoothness**: Local variation in radius lengths
- **Compactness**: PerimeterÂ² / Area - 1.0
- **Concavity**: Severity of concave portions of the contour
- **Concave points**: Number of concave portions of the contour
- **Symmetry**
- **Fractal dimension**: "Coastline approximation" - 1

### Target
- **Diagnosis**: Malignant (M) or Benign (B)
