Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a breast cancer diagnosis based on patient data.

Dataset
We use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features
Radius: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
Texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values
Perimeter
Area
Smoothness: Local variation in radius lengths
Compactness: Perimeter² / Area - 1.0
Concavity: Severity of concave portions of the contour
Concave points: Number of concave portions of the contour
Symmetry
Fractal dimension: "Coastline approximation" - 1
Target
Diagnosis: Malignant (M) or Benign (B)

Model
We explore various machine learning algorithms including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
We utilize techniques like cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection to optimize the models.

Results
Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. Below is the performance of various models:

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	XX%	XX%	XX%	XX%
Decision Tree	XX%	XX%	XX%	XX%
Random Forest	XX%	XX%	XX%	XX%
SVM	XX%	XX%	XX%	XX%
k-NN	XX%	XX%	XX%	XX%
